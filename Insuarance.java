// An Insurance company follows following rules to calculate 
// premium. 
// (1)  If a personâ€™s health is excellent and the person is between 
// 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a city and is a male 
// then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy 
// amount cannot exceed Rs. 2 lakhs. 
// (2)  If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that 
// the sex is female then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand 
// and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh. 
// (3)  If a personâ€™s health is poor and the person is between 25 
// and 35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male 
// then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy 
// cannot exceed Rs. 10,000. 
// (4)  In all other cases the person is not insured. 
// Write a program to output whether the person should be 
// insured or not, his/her premium rate and maximum amount 
// for which he/she can be insured.
